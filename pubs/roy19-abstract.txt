Edge sensing with micro-power pulse-Doppler radars is an emergent domain in monitoring and surveillance with several smart city applications. Existing solutions for the clutter versus multi-source radar classification task are limited in terms of either accuracy or efficiency, and in some cases, struggle with a trade-off between false alarms and recall of sources. We find that this problem can be resolved by learning the classifier across multiple time scales. We propose a multi-scale, cascaded recurrent neural network architecture, MSC-RNN, comprised of an efficient multi-instance learning (MIL) recurrent neural network (RNN) for clutter discrimination at a lower tier, and a more complex multi-source RNN classifier for source classification at the upper tier. By controlling the invocation of the upper RNN with the help of the lower tier conditionally, MSC-RNN achieves an overall accuracy of 0.972 with an estimated duty cycle of &lt3%. Our approach holistically improves the accuracy, energy efficiency, and per-class recalls over shallow and deep ML models suitable for radar inferencing. Notably, we outperform cross-domain handcrafted feature engineering with time-domain deep feature learning, while also being an order of magnitude more efficient than the former class of solutions.
